##**OpenVenTUM**
## Inspiration
During the **Corona** (COVID-19) pandemic it became obvious that a **lack** of healthcare workers and equipment can cause a severe impact in the fight against the virus. The rapidly growing **shortage of ventilators** is becoming of dire concern. What is less widely discussed is the **concerning shortage of professionals** to manage ventilators, as increasing numbers of healthcare workers are becoming **infected, hospitalized, and dying**. We were inspired by this problem to provide a **cutting edge solution**, which can **significantly facilitate** the work of the doctors.

## What it does
Our platform provides intuitive interface which shows **real time** ventilator information for multiple patients on the same place, so that the medical workers can monitor the health status of their patients easily on the go. This tool will not only **save time**, but it uses **AI** to automatically monitor the health status of the patient from the information provided from the ventilators. Another **special feature** of our platform is that in **critical** cases, when the patients are more than the ventilators, the AI can group patient with similar ventilator needs. **OpenVenTUM** covers all standards and requirements for medical devices.

## How we built it
We built this application using react, java, python and various packages to ensure the secure and smooth work of our platform. We also implemented **Machine Learning** using scikit-learn library which analyses the data.

## Challenges we ran into
We used a lot of new technologies and it was hard to start, but once we got used to them, we accomplished most of our goals.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- learned new technologies
- get to know with ventilators
- **teamwork**

## What we learned
Through this platform, we learned the importance of using data and providing it in a user friendly way to help and save time. It is of a great importance to **arm the medical workers** with the best equipment, so they can maximise their efficiency and save **as many lives as possible**.

## What's next for OpenVenTUM
- get feedback and **improve** the current status of **OpenVenTUM**
- brainstorm ideas from doctors
- add more patient status measurements from other devices
- mobile application
